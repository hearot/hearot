I am **Gabriel** (also known as *hearot*), an italian boy who just finds programming relaxing. I'm a huge fan of mathematics, and you will surely find what I've thought so far on [my personal website](https://hearot.it).

- 🤖 I'm working on personal projects right now, yet I have contributed to [Pyrubrum](https://github.com/hearot/pyrubrum), which I recommend you to check out.
- 📖 I am also running a blog on [hearot.it](https://hearot.it).
- 👓 I enjoy reading about the great deeds from [Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan)! Though, I am not a weeb (not anymore, at least!) and I seldom read some manga, meaning that I'm actually reading books rather than manga at the moment, as you might know if you followed me on my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119841930-gabriel).
- ❔ The name *hearot* has no true meaning, since it came to my mind randomly. Yet there does exist a mythological place named [Heorot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heorot), which, unfortunately, is not related to me... unless!?
- 🎙️ hearot is pronounced [*/hirot/*](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=hirot).
