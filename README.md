as you probably already know, i'm gabriel (aka hearot). there is no meaning behind
my username, since plenty of people have already asked me (nay, it does not come
from beowulf either). it is just a random name i made up when i was a kid.
i live near florence, italy.

i'm not a computer science student, nor a programmer, nor a software engineer.
i'm a maths student at the [university of pisa](https://www.dm.unipi.it/en/).
nevertheless i'm used to coding scripts and programs whenever i'm feeling to
(this website is not an exception either). you may find some excerpts of my code
here on github.

i enjoy playing some videogames, but
i wouldn't call myself a gamer. i'm a big fan of formula 1, though. i support
the ferrari f1 team, and i enjoy watching (almost) every grand prix.

i'm an old fan of telegram, which explains why i'm using it all the time.
in fact, my first script was a telegram bot that i wrote in php.
then, i fell in love with python; thus i attended multiple conferences
regarding it (pycon nove, pycon x, pycon 22) as well as other
events (golab 2018, golab 2019).
